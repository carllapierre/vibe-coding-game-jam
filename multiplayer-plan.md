# Food Fight FPS - Multiplayer Implementation Plan

## Context

The Food Fight FPS is currently a single-player game where players engage in food-based combat. To enhance the game experience, we're planning to implement multiplayer functionality using Colyseus, allowing multiple players to join the same game world and compete against each other.

## Current State

- Single-player food fight FPS game
- Character models exist in the CharacterRegistry but no avatars implemented yet
- Game objects and environment models are managed through ObjectRegistry
- The main world is built and will serve as the lobby

## Goals

1. Enable multiple players to join the same game world
2. Implement player synchronization (movement, actions, state)
3. Create a lobby system in the main world
4. Deploy the solution using Docker for easy scaling

## Technical Requirements

1. Colyseus server implementation
2. Client-side integration with the existing game
3. Player representation and synchronization
4. State management for game objects and interactions
5. Room management for lobby
6. Docker deployment configuration

## Architecture Design

### Server Architecture

```
+-------------------+        +-------------------+
|                   |        |                   |
|  Game Client      |<------>|  Colyseus Server  |
|  (Frontend)       |        |  (Backend)        |
|                   |        |                   |
+-------------------+        +-------------------+
```

### Server Components

1. **Lobby Room**: Main area where players can interact and engage in food fights
2. **Player State**: Schema for synchronizing player information including combat interactions

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Server Setup

1. Create a new Colyseus server project
   ```
   npm create colyseus-app@latest ./food-fight-server
   ```
2. Define the Lobby Room:
   - Custom implementation for the lobby where all players interact

### 2. State Definitions

1. Define Player schema:
   - id
   - position
   - rotation
   - character model (from CharacterRegistry)
   - health/status
   - current equipped food item
   - score

2. Define Lobby schema:
   - players (collection)
   - interactive game objects (food items, interactive elements)
   - world state

### 3. Room Implementation

#### Lobby Room
- Player connection/disconnection handling
- Character selection
- Player movement and action synchronization
- Combat mechanics (damaging other players)
- Food item spawning and management
- Chat functionality (optional)

### 4. Client Integration

1. Implement Colyseus client in the frontend:
   ```
   npm install colyseus.js
   ```

2. Create connection manager to handle:
   - Server connection
   - Lobby joining
   - State synchronization
   - Event handling

3. Update character representation:
   - Extend CharacterRegistry to support networked players
   - Implement avatar visualization based on character selection

4. Implement client prediction and reconciliation:
   - Apply local inputs immediately
   - Reconcile with server state updates
   - Implement interpolation for smooth movement

### 5. Testing Strategy

Local development testing
   - Single instance testing
   - Multiple client testing on same machine

### 6. Docker Deployment

1. Create Dockerfile for the Colyseus server:
```dockerfile
FROM node:16

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 2567

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

2. Create docker-compose.yml for local testing and deployment:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  colyseus:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "2567:2567"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    restart: always

volumes:
  app-data:
```

## Future Enhancements

1. Persistent player profiles and statistics
2. Matchmaking system and dedicated match rooms
3. More sophisticated matchmaking based on skill levels
4. Spectator mode
5. Custom game settings
6. Tournament support
7. Cross-platform support
8. Scaling with Redis for higher player counts

## Conclusion

This multiplayer implementation using Colyseus will transform the Food Fight FPS into an engaging multiplayer experience focused on lobby gameplay. The architecture is designed to be maintainable, with Docker deployment ensuring consistent environments across development and production. As the project evolves, additional features like dedicated match rooms and more sophisticated matchmaking can be added.
